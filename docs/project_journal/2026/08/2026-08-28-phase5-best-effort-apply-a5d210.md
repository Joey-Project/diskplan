# Phase 5 Best-Effort Apply

## Summary

- Add the typed best-effort apply coordinator behind the Phase 4 authorization boundary.
- Add a raw-argv generic removal adapter, per-step post-verification, event streaming, and
  optional nonfatal audit output.

## Current State

- Runtime units preserve the validated dependency direction and collapse authorized APFS
  release components so every owner executes at most once. Compound owners retain and execute
  their internal DAG, and only downstream owners skip after a failure.
- A unit receives an exact read-only JIT snapshot before mutation. The request binds the current
  authorization, generation, epoch, exact actions/groups, and a one-shot nonce; stale, reused,
  incomplete, or failed evidence cannot reach an adapter.
- Independent units continue after adapter failure or cancellation. Dependents are skipped
  when any prerequisite unit is not successful. Cancellation, expiry, and supersession stop new
  owner actions; no rollback is claimed.
- Generic removal uses `/bin/rm` through raw `posix_spawn` argv with descriptor-relative
  no-follow namespace, identity, access, provider/mount, ACL/flags, and content preflights.
  Content-stable actions cannot use this pathname adapter. The child has no terminal stdin and
  is supervised as a process group across cancellation and deadline expiry.
- Force warnings are bound into apply review and require explicit confirmation before
  authorization. Runtime warnings remain a secondary event.
- Connected APFS units require a typed `allocationGroupReleased` topology proof after their
  owner steps; target absence alone cannot claim shared-space release.
- Git worktree removal now uses exclusive same-filesystem quarantine, descriptor identity and
  subtree verification, typed restore/retained recovery, and post-removal administrative
  cleanup. Administrative cancellation, deadline, or failure after root deletion is a typed
  partial/expected residual, and no new cleanup process starts after cancellation or expiry.
  The production composition router cannot send Git or unconfigured specialized actions
  through generic removal.
- Authorization is registry/generation-backed until its single claim, so any newer preparation
  revokes an older unconsumed authorization.
- Shell/TUI events require no persistence. Optional audit failures, including `ENOSPC`, are
  reported but cannot stop cleanup.

## Task List

- [x] Add typed execution units, adapter operations, outcomes, post-verification, and events.
- [x] Add best-effort dependency scheduling and compound release owner deduplication.
- [x] Add per-unit JIT revalidation and mutation firewall boundaries.
- [x] Add raw-byte generic remove with explicit ordinary/force command shapes.
- [x] Add fixture test source for partial failure, cancellation, JIT replacement, APFS owner
  deduplication, authorization replay, audit failure, and temporary-root removal races.
- [x] Integrate the corrected Phase 4 engine-owned authorization/evidence source and fresh epoch
  contract.
- [x] Bind force confirmation, single-use authorization generation, fresh JIT capture/nonce, and
  final descriptor recollection into the apply authority.
- [x] Add compound owner DAG semantics and typed allocation-group post-verification.
- [x] Finish the dedicated Git worktree quarantine adapter and production adapter composition.
- [x] Complete static adversarial fixtures and documentation review.
- [x] Run focused/full Swift gates, release integration, journal validation, and formatting.
- [ ] Complete frozen-range review and the signed landing commit.

## Handoff

- Phase: Phase 5 implementation and local validation complete.
- Next step: complete frozen-range review and land the signed commit.
- Blocker: none.

## Evidence

- Accepted architecture: `docs/design/accepted-plan.md`.
- Detailed contract: `docs/design/best-effort-apply.md`.
- Phase 4 boundary: `docs/design/revalidation-and-dry-run.md`.
- Focused `swift test --filter DiskplanExecutionTests`: 62 tests passed.
- Serial full `swift test --no-parallel`: 133 tests passed.
- Parallel `swift test`: all Phase 5 execution tests passed, but the pre-existing
  `boundProviderProbePreservesSubsecondDeadlineAndRereadsPolicy` timing assertion failed in two
  full concurrent runs and passed when run alone; no production change was made for this
  parallel-only flake.
- Production `swift build -c release --product diskplan-engine`: passed.
